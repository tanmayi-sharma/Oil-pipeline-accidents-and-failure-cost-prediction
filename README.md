Engineered a Machine Learning model to classify the type of pipeline accident and predicted the cost suffered. Performed Data wrangling and PCA on the acquired data and successfully captured predominant features. Boosted the accuracy to 87% by formulating K-Nearest Neighbour classifier algorithm, a supervised learning algorithm, when compared to Logistic Regression, XGBoost, RandonForest, and Balanced Bagged classifier algorithms.
